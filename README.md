# Implement-a-Differential-Drive-Robot-Controller-with-RPM-Computation-and-Waypoint-Navigation
This project implements a ROS 2-based controller for a differential drive robot, enabling it to process velocity commands, compute RPM for each wheel, and navigate between waypoints using PID control. The system is designed for use with Gazebo Harmonic+ and ROS 2 Humble or later.
